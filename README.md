# Oil-Production-Flow-Rate-Prediction-Deep-Neural-Network
Oil Production Flow Rate Prediction with Deep Neural Network Algorithm such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). This Model will testing with Validation method called Walk-Forward Validation (WFV). Basically the validation seperate in two part, the first WFV over actual data and WFV over predicted data.
